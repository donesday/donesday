# DONESDAY

## What?!

Donesday is an open event format for procrastinators to come together and get shit done. Yes, we just come together, list our long-dreaded tasks and get them done (or at least make some progress), while sitting next to each other. Occasionally we chat and help each other through a particularly difficult block. But mostly we just sit silently and do shit.

Donesday works as a placebo deadline. And as most placebos it does work, as long as you make-believe that it is real. Other people (who encourage you on progress and boo you on procrastination) help as well. Some peer pressure, you know.

And then there is beer and music at the end (a.k.a. End Of The World Party). Smart people call it gratification, but I just call it beer.

## What you need

* A room full of procrastinators, ideally on a rainy Saturday.
* A wall to stick tasks to (with a "TODO" sign on it)
* A bin to throw done tasks into (with a "DONE" sign on it)
* Some tape to mark 242cm distance from the bin. That's where you throw done tasks from.
* An alarm clock (pomodoro will do, or you can use our digital version - coming soon).
* One panic hat for every 10 participants. Any hat will do, but you need to attach a note to it that says "Let's Panic"
* One leader hat for the participant that at any given moment of time has the most "done" tasks in the bin. Any hat will do that says "DonesKing".
* Beer & Donuts (for the afterparty)

## The Rules

1. When you arrive at the location, put at least one task on the donesday wall (using post-it notes). In "strict mode" you also need to switch your phone off and hand it over to security people.
2. Then look at other people's tasks and mark your name on at least one that you are willing to help with.
3. Each round is 25 mins working + 15 mins talking (pomodoro style). You can have as many rounds as you wish (normally from 5 to 9 rounds within one Donesday, before you start the party).
4. When you finish a task - take the post-it note and throw it into the donesday bin from the marked point (242cm precisely from the donesday bin). 
5. If you hit it, you get a point.
6. At any given moment during the day, the person with the most points gets to wear a DonesKing hat and feel cool for a while.
7. If some participant gets really stuck and screwed up, they can wear a panic hat and scream "Let's Panic", so that other participant can stop whatever they are doing and provide help. Every participant can use a panic hat only once during the day. 
8. After the end of the last round - the DonesKing participant gets a chance to be the DJ (or to nominate a DJ) and the End of the world party" starts. Beer and optional donuts are provided by the organizer (in exchange for a small participation fee or for free if they are overly altruistic).
9. All drunk and happy everyone goes home - till next time that is (we recommend to participate in a Donesday at least twice a month).

## Remote participation

Yes you can participate remotely if your task(s) requires being elsewhere. But it's not nearly as much fun.

## Donesong
Donesday has an official song. [Here it is](https://soundcloud.com/george-strakhov/donesong).

Can sing better than me? A pull request is _very_ welcome.
Lyrics available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donesday/donesday/master/song/donesong-text.md).

## Donesdance
At the end of every Donesday we throw the end of the world party, called Donesdance.
The only prerequisites are beer and music.
Burning the to-do post-its from the Dones bin is usually fun. But only do this if you are outside and know what you are doing.
There is no special dance at the moment, but eventually our wonderful would-be community may come up with the moves (pull request welcome!) and then you will have to learn it.
