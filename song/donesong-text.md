[Chorus:]

Done, done, done, done done, da-da-done,
Done, done, done, done done, da-da-done,
Done, done, done, done done, da-da-done,
Done, done, da-da-da-done, da-da-da-done!

I woke up one day with a briliant idea,
It could change the world (or at least my career),
So I took out my to-do list and I wrote it down,
It was item three thousand and forty one!
And there it got stuck, 'cause life got in the way: 
When things don't have a deadline on your to-do list they stay!
But today we will end all the guilt and frustration
As we take our last stand against procrastination!

[Chorus]

Today we will get altogether and sit ourselves down,
We will list all the things that need to get done,
We will lock the door and we will stop the talking,
And the music will play and we will all be working!
We'll forget all the reasons not to do it that we had,
We'll forget all about our existential dread,
We'll forget our joys and we'll forget our sorrows
And get this shit done, like there's no tomorrow!

[Chorus]

Today we'll put the long-dreaded tasks on the wall,
And we will take them one by one and we'll burn them all!
And if there is a task that resists your brute force,
You can help me with my shit and I'll help you with yours!
We'll forget about our emails, we'll forget about our phones,
We'll forget about the last season of "The Game of Thrones",
With the skills that we have and the skills we can borrow
We will get this shit done, like there's no tomorrow!

[Chorus]

Oh, the end is near,
That's when we can have our beer!
Oh, just keep up the fight,
If we get all shit done, we will dance tonight!

Done is better than some day,
Done is better than no way,
Done can send shit flying with a one-inch punch,
That's why done always eats perfect for lunch!

[Chorus]

We'll forget about the reasons not to do it that we had,
We'll forget all about our existential dread,
With the skills that we have and the skills we can borrow
We will get this shit done, like there's no tomorrow!
